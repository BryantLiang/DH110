# DH 110 Assignment02: Pilot Usability Testing
### Bryant Liang

## Usability Test: [RecycleByCity](https://www.recyclebycity.com)
RecycleByCity is a website that aims to reduce the amount of recyclables that end up in landfills, as those materials could be used to benefit our communities. To do this, Recycle By City consists of a recycling guide that can be filtered by city, that assists users in identifying which waste goes into which bins.

### Purpose of Testing

#### List of usability issues from heuristic evaluations
* Unconventional path to the About page 
* Quiz mechanics violate heuristics such as error prevention, recognition rather than recall, and helping users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. 
* Finding answers to a question 

The purpose of conducting this pilot usability test for RecycleByCity’s website is to identify how usable features are such as the about page navigation, quiz mechanics, and finding answers to a question a user may have. Through my heuristic evaluations, I discovered that each of these features violated at least one of the 10 usability heuristics, as listed by Jakob Niielsen. Therefore, the usability test will shed light on whether or not these violated heuristics are drastic enough to impact a user experience. If the usability test shows that user experience was negatively affected, suggestions can be made on how to address these issues. I will be testing this through the Zoom platform using my laptop and my participant’s laptop and having the participant share their screen while they attempt to complete a series of tasks related to these features.

## Reflection
  Reflecting on the usability test, the main takeaway I got was that the things a regular user notices compared to me conducting a heuristic evaluation is drastically different. Since I was assigned to find usability issues, I was able to notice several, but a regular user does not notice these and brushes pass them. This can also indicate that these issues are low priority and are more cosmetic issues than usability issues. The participant did point out confusing wording that I missed at the end of the quiz section, which could be addressed. I also learned it was difficult to stay neutral the whole time, especially because I knew the participant. It felt wrong to leave them confused as I watched them try and complete the task. 
  
  Overall, the interview was efficient and flowed smoothly as there were no major points of confusion from the participant during the process. However, I noticed that some sections of the copied sections didn’t flow very well and had text that did not apply to the current pilot usability test, such as the statement stating that we were testing an unreleased website. There was also one sentence that used “he” instead of “they” which may make participants feel excluded.  Also, I didn’t realize I had to select checkboxes instead of multiple choice for the task steps so that they were able to check multiple boxes. 
  
  To improve on my usability testing for the future, I have made edits throughout the form fixing typos and editing and inserting text to allow the process to flow better. Also, I think I should work to provide more context for sections of the website, such as the Recycling Guide, since the tasks didn’t directly cover it, but used the section as context. Another thing I want to improve on is also staying unbiased, but also not being too silent. I would like to find that balance where the participant doesn't feel isolated but I also don’t affect the results. Overall, I should run it through with another person before conducting it with a participant, just so I can see if everything runs smoothly.
