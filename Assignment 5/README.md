# DH 110 Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototyping
## Bryant Liang

## Description of Project

### Summary of User Research
Through a heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and a contextual inquiry, the main finding I discovered was that users valued efficiency when searching for clarifications on proper waste disposal. Therefore creating the least amount of screens and steps was the main focus for me when creating these low-fidelity wireframes. I also took into account the fact that not all users only want quick answers when designing my prototype. 

### Persona
My user personas detail two potential target users
* Raymond, a 25 year old recent college graduate and mechanical engineer based in Los Angeles who is aware of environmental problems through his major and wants to contribute to a more sustainable world. 
* Meredith is a 35 year old software engineer living in San Francisco with her family. Her goal is to be confident in sorting trash in order to do her part and help her family do their part in proper recycling. 

### Features
With the insights from the research in mind, the features that I showcased in the low-fidelity prototypes include the search feature, the scan feature, and the dive deeper feature. 

### Purpose
The purpose of creating low-fidelity prototypes is to test users using rudimentary screens in order to isolate the testing for the flow of the application and its basic features, instead of its aesthetics. It is a quick way to test out features and make changes before finalizing into more advanced designs.
