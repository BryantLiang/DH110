# DH 110 Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototyping
## Bryant Liang

## Description of Project

### Summary of User Research
Through a [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%201), [usability testing](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/assignment02), and a [contextual inquiry](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%203), the main finding I discovered was that users valued efficiency when searching for clarifications on proper waste disposal. Therefore creating the least amount of screens and steps was the main focus for me when creating these low-fidelity wireframes. I also took into account the fact that not all users only want quick answers when designing my prototype. 

### Persona
My [user personas](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/blob/main/Assignment%204/README.md) detail two potential target users:
* Raymond, a 25 year old recent college graduate and mechanical engineer based in Los Angeles who is aware of environmental problems through his major and wants to contribute to a more sustainable world. 
* Meredith is a 35 year old software engineer living in San Francisco with her family. Her goal is to be confident in sorting trash in order to do her part and help her family do their part in proper recycling. 

### Features
With the insights from the research in mind, the features that I showcased in the low-fidelity prototypes include the search feature, the scan feature, and the dive deeper feature. 

### Purpose
The purpose of creating low-fidelity prototypes is to test users using rudimentary screens in order to isolate the testing for the flow of the application and its basic features, instead of its aesthetics. It is a quick way to test out features and make changes before finalizing into more advanced designs.

## Lo-fi Wireflow Testing
* Confusions with loading screen, scanning screen, 
* Tester successfully ompleted both tasks

## Reflection
Creating the low-fidelity prototype was a cool experience because I was finally able to create something tangible and shareable based on the user research I have done, although it was very basic. I learned that it was important to make sure the wireflows ran smoothly before testing it with a user because I found various bugs while I was testing before I showed it to my tester. 
The time it took to complete the task was efficient which was my intended goal as that was a priority I deduced from user testing. My tester was able to complete both the tasks relatively quickly and was not stuck on any part for an extended period of time. He did not have any notable issues with the flow of the features. 

However, there were some aspects of my prototype that could have run smoother, such as the loading screens and the scanning screens. I didn’t know how to represent these processes in a low-fidelity prototype since they are typically automatic processes that would move a user to another screen. On the next revisions, I would try to implement a timer feature where it would automatically move onto the next screen so it is more intuitive for the user. There was also some confusion on what “123 searches” meant in the search results screen because it could be interpreted as showing 1 out of 123 searches or 123 searches by other people. This is something I will clarify in the next prototype. 

My tester also mentioned some aesthetic changes such as rounding certain buttons, increasing the font size of texts, and creating bigger images that I will take into account for the revisions. I also noticed my tester was clicking on features that I did not wireflow yet despite them not having to do with the task. This could indicate that a user could get distracted easily while doing a task which either means I should minimize distractions or I should provide some sort of reminder in the wireflow of other features that revert the user back to the original task.
