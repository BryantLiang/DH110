# DH 110 Assignment02: Pilot Usability Testing
### Bryant Liang

## Usability Test: [RecycleByCity](https://www.recyclebycity.com)
RecycleByCity is a website that aims to reduce the amount of recyclables that end up in landfills, as those materials could be used to benefit our communities. To do this, Recycle By City consists of a recycling guide that can be filtered by city, that assists users in identifying which waste goes into which bins.

### Purpose of Testing

#### List of usability issues from heuristic evaluations
* Unconventional path to the About page 
* Quiz mechanics violate heuristics such as error prevention, recognition rather than recall, and helping users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. 
* Finding answers to a question 

The purpose of conducting this pilot usability test for RecycleByCity’s website is to identify how usable features are such as the about page navigation, quiz mechanics, and finding answers to a question a user may have. Through my heuristic evaluations, I discovered that each of these features violated at least one of the 10 usability heuristics, as listed by Jakob Niielsen. Therefore, the usability test will shed light on whether or not these violated heuristics are drastic enough to impact a user experience. If the usability test shows that user experience was negatively affected, suggestions can be made on how to address these issues. I will be testing this through the Zoom platform using my laptop and my participant’s laptop and having the participant share their screen while they attempt to complete a series of tasks related to these features.
