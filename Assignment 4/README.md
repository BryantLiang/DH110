# DH 110 Assignment 4: Persona + Scenarios

## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
* UX storytelling is important in my project because it allows me to empathize with the target user’s goals and attitudes. It provides me insight on how users would go about using my app and in what contexts and allows me to brainstorm features that will cater to their needs. It is important to place myself into a user’s shoes because the features I value may not align exactly with a user’s values.

## Scenarios and Journey Maps

### Raymond's Scenario and Journey Map
Raymond lives in a Apartment in Sawtelle and enjoys both eating out and making food at home. Today he has decided to make spaghetti and meatballs. He invites some of his friends over to enjoy the meal with him and they have a good time eating and talking. 

After the meal, Raymond decides to clean up and washes the dishes and puts away the leftovers. He gets to the empty jar of pasta sauce and heads to throw it into the recycling. However, he hesitates because there are still elements of sauce in the jar and sauce belongs in the compost bin. He asks his friends if they know which bin he should throw it into and they are unsure and tell him to just throw it in the recycling. He doesn’t feel confident about this so he decides to confirm before throwing it away. 

He then goes on his phone and searches for “pasta jar” on the app. The location for the app has been automatically set to Los Angeles, as Raymond has already set his location from a previous use. The app displays images of multiple pasta jars made with different materials, so Raymond finds one that looks similar to the jar he has and clicks on it. It shows a blue bin and says that the specific pasta jar he has is recyclable. It also displays on the screen that 150 users had looked up how to dispose of this pasta jar in the last week, which makes Raymond happy that others are being conscious about their disposal as well. There is an asterisk by the answer that leads to a “special conditions apply” section. Since Raymond wants to be 100% confident in his decision, he clicks on this section and reads more about why the pasta jar is recyclable, what the jar and lid can be recycled into, and about specific steps to take such as cleaning the sauce from the jar and to separate the lid and the jar when recycling it. 

With this new information, Raymond cleans the jar and the lid, and leaves it to dry overnight. In the morning he throws the jar and the lid separately into the recycling bin and feels a bit empowered, knowing how to properly recycle thai pasta jar. He decides to share a screenshot of the information he found on the app with his friends, in order to spread the knowledge about recycling.

### Meredith's Scenario and Journey Map
Meredith is enjoying some time off from work on the weekend and is spending time with her two kids at the park. The kids play on the playground for a bit but return soon to eat some snacks that Meredith has packed. She gives them both a pouch of GoGo Squeez applesauce and they finish it quickly. One of her children asks, “Mommy, where should I throw this away?” Meredith is happy that her child is being conscious about disposing of trash responsibly, but she thinks about it and is unsure about the correct bin as well. She is a bit confused because the pouch contains multiple parts, such as the lid, the pouch, and the food inside. She takes the pouch from them and tells them to play, and she decides to find out more information about how to properly dispose of these applesauce pouches. She tries to look at the packaging first to see if there's an indicator of how to properly dispose of it but she is unable to find one.

She goes onto the app and uses the camera feature to scan the GoGo Squeez applesauce pouches. The app recognizes the brand and the make of the pouch and shows her an image of the applesauce she is holding. She clicks into the image and it shows that there are specific instructions for properly recycling the pouches. The cap is recyclable, but it states that the pouch has to be recycled specially at a supermarket. This surprises Meredith, but she decides to follow the instructions and recycles the cap, while saving the pouch in a bag she has brought. Curious to learn more about why this is the case, she returns to the app and clicks into “Read More” which provides her with some insight about why this product should be recycled this way. After this Meredith feels content about her choice and feels confident about using the app for future ambiguous trash items. When her children come back, Meredith tells them how to throw away applesauce packets in the future, and encourages them to ask her if they don’t know which bin a piece of trash goes. 

Meredith gets home and her husband asks about her day at the park and questions her about why she is carrying the applesauce packets. Meredith smiles and explains what she learned from the app to her husband, referring to the previous searches on the app as reference to show him.
