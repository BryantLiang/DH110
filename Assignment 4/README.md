# DH 110 Assignment 4: Persona + Scenarios
#### Bryant Liang

## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
* UX storytelling is important in my project because it allows me to empathize with the target user’s goals and attitudes. It provides me insight on how users would go about using my app and in what contexts and allows me to brainstorm features that will cater to their needs. It is important to place myself into a user’s shoes because the features I value may not align exactly with a user’s values.
