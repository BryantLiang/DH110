# DisposeMe

### Bryant Liang | DH 110 Fall 2022

## Introduction
This project took place over Fall Quarter 2022 in DH 110 and consisted of designing a solution that addressed one of the UN's 17 sustainability goals. I wanted to address the issue of irresponsible consumption and production and ideated that assisting people in sorting their waste correctly could lead to more recycling and lead to a more sustainable use of resources, thus working towards responsible consumption and production. My process throughout the quarter included conducting UX research, engaging in UX storytelling, wireframing and prototyping, all which ultimately led to a design of an app called DisposeMe. DisposeMe is designed to be a platform that makes it easier for users to properly determine how to sort their waste. 

## Design Statement
According to Waste Management, an American trash collecting company, the average recycling contamination rate — or disposal of trash or recyclables in the wrong recycling bin — is 25%, meaning 1 in 4 items thrown in a recycling bin isn't recyclable. This is alarming as we are consuming so many products everyday, and we are missing out on the chance of recycling a quarter of our products. Therefore, in my project, I wanted to address this issue of irresponsible consumption by reducing the average recycling contamination rate. DisposeMe acheives this goal and aims to do so in a simple and efficient manner for users.

## Research

### Competitor Analysis: [Heuristic Evaluation](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%201)

I conducted a heurstic evaluation on two websites: RecycleByCity and Terracycle. Recycle By City aims to reduce the amount of recyclables that end up in landfills, while Terracycle aims to adress overconsumption through offering the ability for users to recycle complex trash, that is normally not recycled. I chose to analyze these websites because they were websites that had similar goals to mine where they would help make the recycling process easier and more clear to people who were interested. 

### Competitor Analysis: [Pilot Usability Test](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/assignment02)

I conducted a pilot usability test for the website RecycleByCity because it was going to be similar to the app I had in mind so I wanted to determine if the usability issues that I found in the heuristic evaluation were issues that a user would encounter as well. I was able to utilize the results of the pilot usability test to design the features of my own app to ensure a better user experience. 

### User Research: [Contextual Inquiry](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%203)

To gather information about my user and how they behave, I conducted a contextual inquiry that consisted of an interview and participatory observation. This contextual inquiry was beneficial as I learned to empathize more with the user as the way a user thinks and behaves is different than how I act or behave or how I perceive a user to act or behave. I observed the user for two tasks: searching for the proper bin for an item and the steps they would take if they were unable to find a definitive answer. I deteremined from this research that one of the main priorities for a user is efficiency when trying to acheive the goal of proper waste disposal. 

### UX Storytelling: [Personas + Scenarios](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%204)

UX storytelling was important in my project because it allows me to empathize with the target user’s goals and attitudes. For this, I created 2 personas and 2 scenarios which provided me with insight on how users would go about using my app and in what contexts. This allowed me to brainstorm features that will cater to their needs. It was important to place myself into a user’s shoes because the features I value may not align exactly with a user’s values.
