# DisposeMe

## Bryant Liang, DH 110, Fall 2022

### Design Statement
According to Waste Management, an American trash collecting company, the average recycling contamination rate — or disposal of trash or recyclables in the wrong recycling bin — is 25%, meaning 1 in 4 items thrown in a recycling bin isn't recyclable. This is alarming as we are consuming so many products everyday, and we are missing out on the chance of recycling a quarter of our products. Therefore, in my project, I wanted to address this problem of irresponsible consumption and reduce the average recycling contamination rate. I did this by creating an app, DisposeMe, that made proper waste disposal easier for users
