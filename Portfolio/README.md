# DisposeMe

### Bryant Liang | DH 110 Fall 2022

## Introduction
This project took place over Fall Quarter 2022 in DH 110 and consisted of designing a solution that addressed one of the UN's 17 sustainability goals. I wanted to address the issue of irresponsible consumption and production and ideated that assisting people in sorting their waste correctly could lead to more recycling and lead to a more sustainable use of resources, thus working towards responsible consumption and production. My process throughout the quarter included conducting UX research, engaging in UX storytelling, wireframing and prototyping, all which ultimately led to a design of an app called DisposeMe. DisposeMe is designed to be a platform that makes it easier for users to properly determine how to sort their waste. 

## Design Statement
According to Waste Management, an American trash collecting company, the average recycling contamination rate — or disposal of trash or recyclables in the wrong recycling bin — is 25%, meaning 1 in 4 items thrown in a recycling bin are not recyclable. This is alarming as we are consuming so many products everyday, and we are missing out on the chance of recycling a quarter of our products. Therefore, in my project, I wanted to address this issue of irresponsible consumption by reducing the average recycling contamination rate by informing people what the proper bin waste goes into. DisposeMe acheives this goal and aims to do so in a simple and efficient manner.

## Research

### Competitor Analysis: [Heuristic Evaluation](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%201)

I conducted a heurstic evaluation on two websites: RecycleByCity and Terracycle. Recycle By City aims to reduce the amount of recyclables that end up in landfills, while Terracycle aims to adress overconsumption through offering the ability for users to recycle complex trash, that is normally not recycled. I chose to analyze these websites because they were websites that had similar goals to mine where they would help make the recycling process easier and more clear to people who were interested.

### Competitor Analysis: [Pilot Usability Test](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/assignment02)

I conducted a pilot usability test for the website RecycleByCity because it was going to be similar to the app I had in mind so I wanted to determine if the usability issues that I found in the heuristic evaluation were issues that a user would encounter as well. I was able to utilize the results of the pilot usability test to design the features of my own app to ensure a better user experience. 

### User Research: [Contextual Inquiry](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%203)

To gather information about my user and how they behave, I conducted a contextual inquiry that consisted of an interview and participatory observation. This contextual inquiry was beneficial as I learned to empathize more with the user as the way a user thinks and behaves is different than how I act or behave or how I perceive a user to act or behave. I observed the user for 2 tasks: searching for the proper bin for an item and the steps they would take if they were unable to find a definitive answer. I deteremined from this research that one of the main priorities for a user is efficiency when trying to acheive the goal of proper waste disposal. 

### UX Storytelling: [Personas + Scenarios](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%204)

UX storytelling was important in my project because it allowed me to empathize with the target user’s goals and attitudes. For this, I created 2 personas and 2 scenarios which provided me with insight on how users would go about using my app and in what contexts. This allowed me to brainstorm features that will cater to their needs. It was important to place myself into a user’s shoes because the features I value may not align exactly with a user’s values.

## Design

### [Low-fidelity Prototype](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%205)

After conducting several rounds of research, I began creating a rough draft of the prototype of my application using Figma. My main emphasis for the low-fidelity prototype was to keep the app simple and easy to use as that was one of the core findings from my research. I created drafts of the onboarding flow, the scan an item wireflow, and search for an item wireflow.

### [Design System](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%206)

In addition, I finalized the stylistic decisions (typography, spacing, font, colors) of the graphical interface and created a design system that I would use while designing the high fidelity prototype.

Using the low-fidelity prototype and the design system I created, I was able to create a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. I utilized Figma's prototyping tools, its overlaying and animations features, and  components. The overall design decisions were based on user research I had conducted in the first phases of this project, as well as industry design standards, such as how search bar interfaces typically look.

## Evaluation and Revision

### [Cognitive Walkthrough and Usability Testing](https://github.com/brygoesmoo/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%207) 

After creating the high-fidelity prototype, I conducted a cognitive walkthrough with 2 classmates and also conducted a usability test with another participant. The cognitive walkthroughs were held in-person during class time and the usability test was conducted over Zoom. With this feedback from these sessions, I was able to revise my prototype and add new features such as more specific instructions and new pop-ups that improved the usability of my app. 

## Reflection

Through the process of creating the DisposeMe prototype, I learned a lot about the design process and was able to gain experience in the skills needed at each stage, whether that be soft skills such as conducting an interview or hard skills such as using Figma. Actually doing each step of the process helped me understand how much work is really put in at each level when designing a product. I also enjoyed tackling the real life issue of sustainability because it felt that the work I was doing was meaningful and relevant.

Conducting UX research and empathizing with the users was fun because it allowed me to be creative and brainstorm many different solutions to solve a user's problem. However, I struggled a bit with the design process because I found it a bit difficult to turn my ideas into designs, especially since I did not have a lot of experience using design platforms and design techniques. I also learned about creating a design system and how meticulous it had to be to ensure the product was consistent and accessible. 

Overall, working on this project was a great experience and beneficial in improving my skills as a UX research and designer. I know that the skills I learned and the experiences I've gained in this class will help me succeed in future design projects as well.
