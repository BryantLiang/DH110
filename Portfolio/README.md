# DisposeMe

## Bryant Liang, DH 110, Fall 2022

### Design Statement
According to Waste Management, an American trash collecting company, the average recycling contamination rate — or disposal of trash or recyclables in the wrong recycling bin — is 25%, meaning 1 in 4 items thrown in a recycling bin isn't recyclable. This is alarming as we are consuming so many products everyday, and we are missing out on the chance of recycling a quarter of our products. Therefore, in my project, I wanted to address this problem of irresponsible consumption and reduce the average recycling contamination rate. I did this by creating an app, DisposeMe, that made proper waste disposal easier for users.

### Research

#### Competitor Analysis: Heuristic Evaluation
I conducted a heurstic evaluation on two websites: RecycleByCity and Terracycle. Recycle By City aims to reduce the amount of recyclables that end up in landfills, while Terracycle aims to adress overconsumption through offering the ability for users to recycle complex trash, that is normally not recycled. I chose to analyze these websites because they were websites that had similar goals to mine where they would help make the recycling process easier and more clear to people who were interested.

#### Competitor Analysis: Pilot Usability Test

I conducted a pilot usability test for the website RecycleByCity because it was going to be similar to the app I had in mind so I wanted to determine if the usability issues that I found in the heuristic evaluation were issues that a user would encounter as well. I was able to utilize the results of the pilot usability test to design the features of my own app to ensure a better user experience.
