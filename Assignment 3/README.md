# DH 110 Assignment03: Contextual Inquiry
### Bryant Liang

## Step 1: Specify the Research Goal and Requirements 

### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
* My project would serve as a general hub for users to identify how to properly sort their trash

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
* The main goal that responsible waste disposal addresses is the goal of responsible consumption and production. Part of the consumption process is properly disposing of it after usage, because if not, it can lead to problems such as inefficient recycling and garbage patches in the ocean. In addition, responsible production will be addressed, as properly recycled materials could be utilized into creating more products and effectively saving resources. 

### What are the traditional/current solutions to satisfy the needs?
* The present solutions to address this need is to either ask someone who is knowledgeable in sorting trash or to look online and browse websites to correctly find the right resource to indicate how to correctly inform you about trash sorting.
* Also, there are often images of the correct types of trash that go into each bin, and through these, you can see explicitly which items belong in which bin and make guided inferences about objects you are unsure of. 
* Another solution is people who know how to sort through trash will manually sort through peopleâ€™s waste. This can be people collecting and sorting the waste before the waste goes into the bins, or people who sort the waste at a facility after it has been thrown away. 

### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved?
* Current limitations with this activity include different locations having different recycling policies, creating a longer process for users to search as they have to ensure the resource they are reading correspond to their area. 
* Also, a lack of education and emphasis on responsible waste disposal leads to a lack of interest in sorting through trash correctly. This leads to a tragedy of the commons effect, as individuals share many resources, so they disregard the importance of properly recycling or composting because they believe the time to properly dispose of waste is not worth their time. By acting in self interest, individuals are contributing to irresponsible waste disposal which is irresponsible consumption as it interferes with recycling if landfill is in the recycling bin.

## Step 2: Target Users

### What are the characteristics of users?
* Demographics: The characteristics of the users would vary from students to working adults, with an age range of 16-65. These users would be well educated and financially stable. 
* Preference: Users would consume a lot of products and also care about environmental issues. 
* Expertise: The users would need to be familiar with the internet and search engines and navigating through websites and apps on mobile as well. 

### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?
* Users would do this activity when they are in the process of throwing away trash, typically in public after a meal or at home after consuming a product. This is likely the time when they begin to wonder where certain pieces of trash go. However, the convenience of a website means that users will be able to utilize the site anywhere. 

### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
* The purpose of the user using the site is to sort their trash appropriately. For a user, they would use the site and quickly find the trash they are trying to throw away, and the site will instruct them on which bin it belongs in depending on their location. To complete the activity, the user would throw away their trash in the instructed bin. 

## Step 3: Pick an Qualitative Research Method
Methods: Interview and Participatory Observation
* The session was conducted over Zoom in order to capture my participant's facial expressions and screen during the screen share, but we were in the same room during the research session. 
* The session was conducted with my roommate has my participant, meaning the location of the session was my participant's home and the typical setting where he would be engaging in these activites. 

**Breakdown**
* Introduction: Brief summary of purpose of session and the terms agreed for the session 
* Background Questions: Confirmation of target market and introduction questions about proper waste disposal.
* Interview: More in-depth questions about proper waste disposal, including questions about participant's experience and knowledge relating to proper waste disposal. 
* Activites/Participant Observation: Presented 2 general activites based on usability test tasks to the participant and observed as the participant worked on the activity. Includes follow-up questions. 
* Closing Questions: Reflection on experience with the activites and final thoughts related to the topic.

## Step 6: Reflection
Overall, the contextual inquiry flowed smoothly because I learned from my mistakes from the usability testing, such as making sure there were no typos and that I ran it through once on my own. Being comfortable with the script also allowed me to deviate from the script a bit and probe further into specific details. 

Next time, I would do an audio test before I begin recording, because my session had some audio problems when we first started, and that resulted in me having to pause the recording and tell my participant to be in the same room as me. 

Something unexpected that happened during the session was the fact that my participant did not click into any of the websites during the activity portion where I was observing. I expected him to do so, so I anticipated the activities would take longer, but he simply searched on Google and based his answer off the auto suggested result. Although unexpected, this was a valuable insight because it shows that my target audience values being time efficient when trying to accomplish the goal of sorting trash correctly, which is something I will keep in mind when creating my product. This was vastly different than the usability test where we started with the participant on the page and instructed them on the specific steps. Also, my participant did not check whether it applied to his specific location or area, and instead just assumed the answer was relevant to his area.  This researcher-participant mismatch was also evident in the usability test, as I assumed the participant would notice certain things, when they did not. 

Another insight I learned was that my product may not be used as often as I initially thought because my participant brought up the point where he would use it less and less because he would begin remembering where to properly dispose of trash. However, this does still provide support for the main activity in terms of informing users how to properly sort their trash.
