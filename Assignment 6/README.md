# DH 110 Assignment 6: Interface Design
## Bryant Liang

## Description of Project

### Purpose of Project

The purpose of my project, RecycleMe, is to help alleviate the struggle of sorting trash into the proper bin in order to encourage responsible consumption. The app will allow users to easily search for answers for an ambiguous piece of trash through the scanning or searching features and through the wide database of information about proper waste disposal by location. 

### Purpose and Process of Interface Design

The purpose of interface design is to create an organized and intuitive layout that is easy to use for all users. Interface design builds off off the research and low fidelity wireframes that were already constructed and turns them into more advanced screens that take into account layout and spacing, colors, and typography.
