# DH 110 Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
## Bryant Liang

## Overview

### Decription of Project
This high fidelity prototype is a representation of the interface of my app, RecycleMe, an app that aims to encourage responsible consumption by allowing users to effectively identify which bin a piece of trash goes into. 

### Purpose and Process
The purpose of creating high-fidelity prototypes is to create an interface that a user can imagine themselves using in an actual app, and that way, usability testing can be conducted based on their usage to further improve upon the app. 

The process of this prototype consisted of using Figma and its features, such as the prototyping tool, overlaying and animations, and the usage of components. The prototype was based off of the low fidelity wireframes that I constructed in Assignment 5 and was designed off of the design system that I created in Assignment 6. The overall design decisions were based on user research I had conducted in the first phases of this project, as well as industry design standards, such as how search bar interfaces typically look. 

## Tasks
* Scan an item to determine which bin it belongs to
* Search an item to determine which bin it belongs to
* Check trending items users are searching for
* Check personal search history
