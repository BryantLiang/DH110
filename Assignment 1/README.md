# [Tentative Title: Responsible Consumption]
## Bryant Liang - DH110-F22 - Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

I aim to create an app that allows you to type an object and the app will tell you which trash can to place it into
- Helps with appropriate recycling (responsible consumption)
- Helps with producing less items such as bags, water bottles, fertilizer
- Helps machines that sort through the bins work more effectively

## Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics
| Heuristic  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **1. Visbility of System Status** | The user is updated about the website's actions through timely feedback|
| **2. Match Between System and the Real World** | The interface should resemble the rules of thumb and conventions of users’ realities |
| **3. User Control and Freedom** | Users should be able to efficiently escape from an erroneous decision |
| **4. Consistency and Standards** | Platform should be consistent throughout in terms of language, actions, concepts |
| **5. Error Prevention** | Design should eliminate commonly made errors or include warnings to prevent errors |
| **6. Recognition Rather than Recall** | Avoid clouding the user's mental capacity by reducing the information they need to remember. Instead, create easy access to instructions, options, and possible actions. |
| **7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use** | Create shortcuts to accelerate actions for experienced users, but does not affect novice users |
| **8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design** | Design should be organized and only include relevant material |
| **9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors** | Error messages should clearly state the error and offer a solution |
| **10. Help and Documentation** | Help pages should be provided for users and should be easy to access, relevant to user’s actions, and include an efficient process to address the issue |



## Website 1: [RecycleByCity](https://www.recyclebycity.com)
<p align="center"> ![Image of RecycleByCity website](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193913174-b9588323-7d83-4cc6-a4c9-2f6b441a3671.png) <p>

Recycle By City aims to reduce the amount of recyclables that end up in landfills, as those materials could be used to benefit our communities. To do this, Recycle By City consists of a recycling guide that can be filtered by city, that assists users in identifying which waste goes into which bins.  

### Initial Overall Evaluation

Overall, the website looks very straightforward and simple to use. There isn't too much content on each page, but it doesn't feel empty either, as there are cute graphics in the header and interactive buttons throughout the site. The design of the site seems like the intended audience is younger, perhaps in the 8-18 range. 

### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visbility of System Status
* Cursor doesn’t get updated to typing cursor even when typing in email in "Stay Informed" section (Severity Rating: 1).

> Recommendation: While this is a minor usability issue, I would recommend changing it so when the email address box is clicked, the hand cursor becomes a typing cursor, to provide feedback to the user.

#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
* About section is vague and does not convey any useful information (Severity Rating: 3). <br> <p align="center"> ![About section](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193916913-01f77bca-a274-4045-93a0-f52485810e06.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Incorporate more detail into this section and/or create a link that redirects user to the About page.

* Drop down menu is unorthodox and not typical of drop down menus found on other sites, as it is vertical instead of horizontal, which causes the top of the screen to be blocked when opened (Severity Rating: 2). <br> <p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193917103-e8a859f6-b9b9-4275-b6e7-bdb6324759db.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Change the drop down menu to be horizontal and have it be on top of the content at the top of the page instead of blocking it. 

#### 3. User control and freedom
* After submitting inputs, there is no way to edit your email or location in the case that you made a mistake (Severity Rating: 2). <br> <p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193921603-234e3017-7a13-4ca6-b6ce-8cc0d9b4b85f.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Allow user to correct a potential typo in both the email or location field, even after clicking submit. 

#### 4. Consistency and standards
* "Household recycling guide" is not capitalized, despite being capitalized in a previous screen (Severity Rating: 2). <br> <p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193935770-737e5fca-864b-49ec-8e0d-15dc8a3715c1.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Capitalize "Household recycling guide" to match capitalization standards on the site.

#### 5. Error prevention
* If a user is taking the quiz and accidentally navigates to another section on the site, the quiz progress is lost. (Severity Rating: 2)
> Recommendation: There should be a warning informing the user that quiz progress will be lost if they continue to navigate away fromt the quiz. 

#### 6. Recognition rather than recall
* When selecting the incorrect bin for a waste item on the quiz, it will notify you of the correct bin. However, it notifies you in a generic black font, so you would have to recall which bin was the correct bin (Severity Rating: 2). <br><p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193937190-ad4b0542-a7d8-45c5-ab8d-b4b2512a3cab.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Change the color of the text to match the color of the corresponding bin (Ex. Trash Bin = Black, Blue Bin = Blue, Yard Bin = Green).

#### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
* There is no way to review quiz results after completing the quiz (Severity Rating: 2). 
> Recommendation: Create an option to let users who have completed the quiz already review their answers and look at the feedback they received on the quiz. 

#### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
* No issue with this heuristic! The website is neat and has relevant information for the user. The graphics and images they selected improve the beauty of the site, and the interactive icons create a natural and familiar experience for the user. 

#### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
* Quiz feedback messages (for correct or incorrect) are identical designs, which makes it hard to distinguish easily if you answered the question right or wrong (Severity Rating: 3). <br> <p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193938229-0d0f8bc0-32d7-4f66-b176-c0bd12cfe977.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Incorporate some color into the feedback messages. The check mark can be colored green to indicate a correct answer, while the x icon can be colored red to indicate an incorrect answer. 

#### 10. Help and documentation
* No help page found; there is an area for contacting the website with any questions or suggestions, but that will take time to receive a response (Severity Rating: 2).
> Recommendation: Create a FAQ page of previosuly asked questions to display to quicken the user experience for a confused user and to minimize incoming questions. 



## Website 2: [TerraCycle](https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/)
![Home page of TerraCycle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193940111-4803e353-7661-4095-adf8-07b00f4d06d3.png)
  
TerraCycle is a service that aims to adress overconsumption through offering the ability for users to recycle complex trash, that is normally not recycled. This includes skincare bottles, Taco Bell's hot sauce packets, old children's toys, etc. TerraCycle offers free and paid services, and also partners with cities and businesses to make recycling easier. 

### Initial Overall Evaluation

As I first browsed through this website, I can tell it is a very professional and well-designed website. The theme of forest green is apparent and effective and the usage of images and graphics are engaging aspects of the site. There is many possible interactions on the site, whether that be clicking on images/buttons or clicking through the different sections they have. However, despite this, the site is organized and does not feel cluttered or crowded at all. The site does seem to target a more educated audience, so the target audience seems to be ages 18-65. 
  
### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visbility of System Status
* Search feedback does not match to the search input at times (Severity Rating: 3). <br> <p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193942538-62979a88-1dc5-4fa7-8833-76a8f181129c.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Update the search feedback to match with the searches, or display a message indicating there are no results that matcht he user's search.

* No feedback when hovering over "Zero Waste Box", "Reuse with Loop", and "Partner with Us" (Severity Rating: 2). <p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193943751-be48d3bd-a717-4247-be9a-a3cdf2d2b940.png) <p>

#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
* There are left and right arrows to navigate left and right in the item carousel, but there is no end, so you are able to infinitely go left or infinitely go right, which may cause slight confusion for users (Severity Rating: 2). <br> <p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193950470-8dfebf7e-b8ad-40c6-9906-f23a7078e33b.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Create a limit of how far you can go left or right in the carousel based on the number of pictures displayed. 
  
#### 3. User control and freedom
* No issue with this heuristic! There are several effective ways users can escape from erroneous decisions such as having breadcrumbs at the top of the page to indicate the previous page a user was on and having an "x" to delete the current search if an incorrect search was typed. 
  
#### 4. Consistency and standards
* Help site has a different design style than the main site which can lead to a sub-optimal user experience due to the inconsistency. (Severity Rating: 2). <br> <p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193951213-1f4bf401-c556-4796-9c93-80a4203bfa80.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Align the design style of the help site with the style of the main site.  

#### 5. Error prevention
* Reuse with Loop header redirects to a whole new website, but it is not clear based on its similarity with the other headers and its placement in the middle of the group. A user may not be expecting to be navigated away from TerraCycle when clicking on this (Severity Rating: 2). 
<p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193952501-5edfc2f1-90f4-4b38-8874-7bb1ce9a3488.png) <p>
> Recommendation: I would recommend to move the header to the far right and provide some indicator that it is not the same as the other headers. Perhaps changing the color, placing a small symbol next to it, or warning the user that it will redirect them to another site. 

#### 6. Recognition rather than recall
* No issue with this heuristic! There is frequent access to "Learn More" buttons which allows the user to see information only if they are interested. There is small descriptions to allow a user to refresh themselves on the topic of a section before clicking into it. 
  

#### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
* No issue with this heuristic! The filtering system was designed well where an experienced user could narrow down their search quickly, but the search function on its own was sufficient enough for novice users. This is similar in the case of 
  

#### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
* No issue with this heuristic! THe website is well designed in a way where sections are easy to access and buttons are intuitive to press. There is not an abundance of information on the home page, as there only is when you decide to click into a specific topic. The graphics complement the headers nicely, and the colors used in the sections fit nicely with the main theme of forest green. 

#### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
* When signing up, I was able to click "Next" after filling out section 1, despite leaving many answers blank. It wasn't until I submitted the entire form that it notifed me I had missing entries. 
> Recommendation: The site should notify users of missing entries when they click "Next" after completing each section, so that users will know immediately when they are missing some information. 

#### 10. Help and documentation
* No issue with this heuristic! There is an entire "Customer Care" section that contains frequently asked questions and has a option to contact the site. The FAQ is organized into sections for easier searching of a problem a user might have. It also contains a search bar if searching for keywords may be faster than looking through sections.
