## Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics
| Heuristic  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **1. Visbility of System Status** | The user is updated about the website's actions through timely feedback|
| **2. Match Between System and the Real World** | The interface should resemble the rules of thumb and conventions of users’ realities |
| **3. User Control and Freedom** | Users should be able to efficiently escape from an erroneous decision |
| **4. Consistency and Standards** | Platform should be consistent throughout in terms of language, actions, concepts |
| **5. Error Prevention** | Design should eliminate commonly made errors or include warnings to prevent errors |
| **6. Recognition Rather than Recall** | Avoid clouding the user's mental capacity by reducing the information they need to remember. Instead, create easy access to instructions, options, and possible actions. |
| **7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use** | Create shortcuts to accelerate actions for experienced users, but does not affect novice users |
| **8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design** | Design should be organized and only include relevant material |
| **9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors** | Error messages should clearly state the error and offer a solution |
| **10. Help and Documentation** | Help pages should be provided for users and should be easy to access, relevant to user’s actions, and include an efficient process to address the issue |
