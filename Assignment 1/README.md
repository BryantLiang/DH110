# [Tentative Title: Responsible Consumption]
## Bryant Liang - DH110-F22 - Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

I aim to create an app that allows you to type an object and the app will tell you which trash can to place it into
- Helps with appropriate recycling (responsible consumption)
- Helps with producing less items such as bags, water bottles, fertilizer
- Helps machines that sort through the bins work more effectively

## Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics
| Heuristic  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **1. Visbility of System Status** | The user is updated about the website's actions through timely feedback|
| **2. Match Between System and the Real World** | The interface should resemble the rules of thumb and conventions of users’ realities |
| **3. User Control and Freedom** | Users should be able to efficiently escape from an erroneous decision |
| **4. Consistency and Standards** | Platform should be consistent throughout in terms of language, actions, concepts |
| **5. Error Prevention** | Design should eliminate commonly made errors or include warnings to prevent errors |
| **6. Recognition Rather than Recall** | Avoid clouding the user's mental capacity by reducing the information they need to remember. Instead, create easy access to instructions, options, and possible actions. |
| **7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use** | Create shortcuts to accelerate actions for experienced users, but does not affect novice users |
| **8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design** | Design should be organized and only include relevant material |
| **9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors** | Error messages should clearly state the error and offer a solution |
| **10. Help and Documentation** | Help pages should be provided for users and should be easy to access, relevant to user’s actions, and include an efficient process to address the issue |



## Website 1: [RecycleByCity](https://www.recyclebycity.com)
<p align="center"> ![Image of RecycleByCity website](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193913174-b9588323-7d83-4cc6-a4c9-2f6b441a3671.png) <p>

Recycle By City is a website that serves as a guide for sorting waste into different bins and allows users to filter by specific cities in the US.  

### Initial Overall Evaluation

Overall, the website looks very straightforward and simple to use. There isn't too much content on each page, but it doesn't feel empty either, as there are cute graphics in the header and interactive buttons throughout the site. The design of the site seems like the intended audience is younger, perhaps in the 8-18 range. 

### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visbility of System Status
* Cursor doesn’t get updated to typing cursor even when typing in email in "Stay Informed" section (Severity Rating: 1).

> Recommendation: While this is a minor usability issue, I would recommend changing it so when the email address box is clicked, the hand cursor becomes a typing cursor, to provide feedback to the user.

#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
* About section is vague and does not convey any useful information (Severity Rating: 3). <br> <p align="center"> ![About section](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193916913-01f77bca-a274-4045-93a0-f52485810e06.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Incorporate more detail into this section and/or create a link that redirects user to the About page.

* Drop down menu is unorthodox and not typical of drop down menus found on other sites, as it is vertical instead of horizontal, which causes the top of the screen to be blocked when opened (Severity Rating: 2). <br> <p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193917103-e8a859f6-b9b9-4275-b6e7-bdb6324759db.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Change the drop down menu to be horizontal and have it be on top of the content at the top of the page instead of blocking it. 

#### 3. User control and freedom
* After submitting inputs, there is no way to edit your email or location in the case that you made a mistake (Severity Rating: 2). <br> <p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193921603-234e3017-7a13-4ca6-b6ce-8cc0d9b4b85f.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Allow user to correct a potential typo in both the email or location field, even after clicking submit. 

#### 4. Consistency and standards
* "Household recycling guide" is not capitalized, despite being capitalized in a previous screen (Severity Rating: 2). <br> <p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193935770-737e5fca-864b-49ec-8e0d-15dc8a3715c1.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Capitalize "Household recycling guide" to match capitalization standards on the site.

#### 5. Error prevention
* If a user is taking the quiz and accidentally navigates to another section on the site, the quiz progress is lost. (Severity Rating: 2)
> Recommendation: There should be a warning informing the user that quiz progress will be lost if they continue to navigate away fromt the quiz. 

#### 6. Recognition rather than recall
* When selecting the incorrect bin for a waste item on the quiz, it will notify you of the correct bin. However, it notifies you in a generic black font, so you would have to recall which bin was the correct bin (Severity Rating: 2). <br><p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193937190-ad4b0542-a7d8-45c5-ab8d-b4b2512a3cab.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Change the color of the text to match the color of the corresponding bin (Ex. Trash Bin = Black, Blue Bin = Blue, Yard Bin = Green).

#### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
* There is no way to review quiz results after completing the quiz (Severity Rating: 2). 
> Recommendation: Create an option to let users who have completed the quiz already review their answers and look at the feedback they received on the quiz. 

#### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
* No issue with this heuristic! The website is neat and has relevant information for the user. The graphics and images they selected improve the beauty of the site, and the interactive icons create a natural and familiar experience for the user. 

#### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
* Quiz feedback messages (for correct or incorrect) are identical designs, which makes it hard to distinguish easily if you answered the question right or wrong (Severity Rating: 3). <br> <p align="center"> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79380837/193938229-0d0f8bc0-32d7-4f66-b176-c0bd12cfe977.png) <p>
> Recommendation: Incorporate some color into the feedback messages. The check mark can be colored green to indicate a correct answer, while the x icon can be colored red to indicate an incorrect answer. 

#### 10. Help and documentation
* No help page found; there is an area for contacting the website with any questions or suggestions, but that will take time to receive a response (Severity Rating: 2).
> Recommendation: Create a FAQ page of previosuly asked questions to display to quicken the user experience for a confused user and to minimize incoming questions.
